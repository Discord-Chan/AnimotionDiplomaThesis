Usability testing is a crucial evaluation method that is used to assess the user 
experience of a web application. It involves having real users perform tasks on a 
website or application and observing their interactions, behaviors, and feedback. 
The goal of usability testing is to determine if the web application is user-friendly, 
efficient, and intuitive for the target audience.

Usability testing is important for web applications for several reasons. First and 
foremost, it allows developers and designers to identify any usability issues before 
the application is released to the public. This can save significant time and money, 
as fixing these issues later in the development cycle can be more time-consuming and costly.

In addition, usability testing helps ensure that the application meets the needs 
and expectations of the target audience. This is essential in ensuring that the 
application is successful and meets the needs of its users. Usability testing 
can also help identify areas for improvement, such as navigation, page layout, 
and content organization.

Another benefit of usability testing is that it provides valuable insight 
into how users interact with the application. This can help developers 
and designers understand how users approach tasks and what their pain 
points are when using the application. This information can then be 
used to make improvements to the user experience and ensure that 
the application is as user-friendly as possible.
